  <strong>An advanced deep learning system for real-time sign language gesture recognition using computer vision and LSTM neural networks</strong>
</p>

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project implements a real-time sign language recognition system that combines the power of MediaPipe Holistic for precise keypoint extraction with LSTM-based deep neural networks for sequence modeling. The system can accurately detect and classify sign language gestures.

Built with computer vision techniques, this system processes live video feeds to extract 1,662 keypoints from face, pose, and hand landmarks, then leverages temporal sequence modeling to understand the dynamic nature of sign language gestures.
